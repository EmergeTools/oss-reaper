  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">What is Reaper?</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    Reaper is a tool for detecting dead code in production. Unlike static
    approaches, Reaper uses data from production - allowing it to detect unused
    code which is impossible to detect via static approaches.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">How Reaper Works</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-2">iOS</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
    On iOS, Reaper works by inspecting the Objective-C and Swift runtime for
    metadata that tracks the lifecycle of types:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>
      For Objective-C classes, it uses the
      <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-sm font-mono"
        >RW_INITIALIZED</code
      >
      bit that is set by the runtime the first time a class is accessed.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Swift types, it uses a combination of runtime flags to determine which
      classes have been accessed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-2">Android</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
    On Android, Reaper works by instrumenting classes at build time:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>
      For each JVM class, it computes the SHA256 hash of the class signature and
      extracts the top 64 bits.
    </li>
    <li>
      It injects code into the
      <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-sm font-mono"
        >&lt;clinit&gt;</code
      >
      (static initializer) and
      <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-sm font-mono"
        >&lt;init&gt;</code
      >
      (constructor) methods to log when the class is used.
    </li>
    <li>At runtime, these hashes are collected and reported to the backend.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Using Reaper</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Using Reaper is a two-step process:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>
      Run a script that statically analyzes your app binary to generate a list
      of all types that Reaper supports.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aggregate reports from production users. The differences between these
      sets are the types that were never used in production, and can be deleted
      from your codebase.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-2">This Backend</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
    This Flask application serves as a minimal backend for collecting Reaper
    reports from iOS and Android apps. It provides:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
    <li>Endpoints for receiving class usage reports</li>
    <li>Storage of reports in sqlite database</li>
    <li>Basic analytics to view collected data</li>
  </ul>
